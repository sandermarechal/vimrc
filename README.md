My (g)Vim configuration
=======================

This is my personal (g)Vim configuration. It is posted here so I can easily share it
between my multiple computers. Feel free to rummage through it and use what you find.

Symlinks
--------

.vimrc and .gvimrc are symlinked as .vim/vimrc and /vim/gvimrc

Vim addons
-----------

I prettu much use Debian everywhere. The current version is Squeeze which comes
with a Vim addon manager. I have the following addons enabled in the addon manager:

* bufexplorer
* markdown-syntax
* matchit
* surround
* taglist

The configuration published here may or may not work without these addons enabled.
